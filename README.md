## 📚 Term Papers - Vehicle Register

Topic: Vehicle Register (topic 13)

### 🌐 Introduction

The vehicle registry is a key application that addresses the problem of efficiently managing information about vehicles and their drivers. This term paper focuses on the design and implementation of a C++ application using the Visual Studio environment.

### 🎯 Problem area

Currently, there is a lack of an effective tool for tracking and penalizing drivers with high number of demerit points. Our application focuses on solving the following problems:

- Lack of a driver-based vehicle retrieval system and vice versa.
- Lack of an effective list of drivers with high number of points for infractions.
- The need to store detailed records of offences.

### 💡 Proposed solution

#### 📊 Data structures

- A list for storing vehicle information.
- List for storing driver information.
- List for keeping records of offences.

#### 🔍 Classification and sorting operations

- Implementation of data classification operations in a sorted sequence of vehicles and drivers.
- Possibility to sort data according to different criteria such as number of points for offences.

#### 🔎 Data search and display

- Functionality to search vehicles and drivers according to different criteria.
- Display a list of vehicles driven by a specific driver and vice versa.

#### 🚨 Managing offences

- Creation of a list of "offenders" based on the number of points for offences.
- Storing records of individual offences.

#### 🕹️ Controlling the application

- User-friendly menu for easy operation of the application.
- Implementation of intuitive operations and data manipulation.

### 🔚 Conclusion

Our application should efficiently solve the problem of tracking and managing information about vehicles, drivers and offenders. By using C++ data structures and algorithms, our solution will be robust and user-friendly.
