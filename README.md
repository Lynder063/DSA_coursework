## Term Papers - Vehicle Register
Topic: Vehicle Register (topic 13)
### Introduction
The vehicle registry is a key application that addresses the problem of efficiently managing information about vehicles and their drivers. This term paper focuses on the design and implementation of a C++ application using the Visual Studio environment.
### Problem area
Currently, there is a lack of an effective tool for tracking and penalizing drivers with high number of demerit points. Our application focuses on solving the following problems:
- Lack of a driver-based vehicle retrieval system and vice versa.
- Lack of an effective list of drivers with high number of points for infractions.
- The need to store detailed records of offences.
### Proposed solution
#### Data structures
- A list for storing vehicle information.
- List for storing driver information.
- List for keeping records of offences.
## Development

#### Classification and sorting operations
- Implementation of data classification operations in a sorted sequence of vehicles and drivers.
- Possibility to sort data according to different criteria such as number of points for offences.
#### Data search and display
- Functionality to search vehicles and drivers according to different criteria.
- Display a list of vehicles driven by a specific driver and vice versa.
#### Managing offences
- Creation of a list of "offenders" based on the number of points for offences.
- Storing records of individual offences.
#### Controlling the application
- User-friendly menu for easy operation of the application.
- Implementation of intuitive operations and data manipulation.
### Conclusion
Our application should efficiently solve the problem of tracking and managing information about vehicles, drivers and offenders. By using C++ data structures and algorithms, our solution will be robust and user-friendly.
